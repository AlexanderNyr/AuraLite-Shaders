**AuraLite** is a modern, lightweight, and highly optimized shader pack built on top of the **OpenGL 4.6 / GLSL 460** standard. It is specifically designed and **tested for Minecraft 1.16 – 26.2 with Sodium + Iris** (and compatible with **OptiFine**, **Oculus**).

AuraLite delivers a breathtaking, realistic visual experience without overcomplicating the screen with bloated post-processing effects (such as aggressive motion blur or heavy bloom). A lightweight HDR bloom was added in v1.0.1 to softly glow emissive sources without smearing the scene. Optional FXAA/SMAA anti-aliasing, SSR, TAA, godrays, and SSAO are profile-scaled so AuraLite keeps **high FPS and smooth frametimes** on modern GPUs.

## 🛠️ What's New in v1.1.1 — *Pipeline Correctness & Shaderpack Packaging Fix*

Version **1.1.1** is a focused bug-fix release for the v1.1.0 codebase. It keeps the visual design intact while fixing configuration and runtime issues found in the shader pipeline:

* Moved HDR/TAA buffer directives to GLSL const directives so `colortex0/1/2/7` formats and persistent TAA history are actually applied by Iris/OptiFine.
* Replaced the custom `SHADOW_RES`/`SHADOW_DISTANCE` menu controls with real `shadowMapResolution` and `shadowDistance` pipeline constants.
* Fixed Nether/End dimension fallback detection so a default `dimension=0` cannot override biome/fog-based Nether/End detection.
* Retuned shadow bias to a balanced value with extra water receiver bias: fixes low-sun Peter Panning while cleaning remaining Shadow Acne on water/ice surfaces.
* Made underwater caustics and ground-mist sheets world-stable by using `cameraPosition`-corrected world coordinates.
* Added performance-neutral height-aware pseudo-3D cloud noise: same ray steps/noise calls, but cloud density now changes through Y instead of looking like flat 2D sheets.
* Added `WET_REFLECTIONS` to the menu and wired it into final-pass SSR wetness.
* Added profile-scaled `SKY_QUALITY`, removed physical-sky hash-noise by switching to centred higher-sample raymarching, fixed `SKY_STYLE` grading so it affects only the base sky, restored readable sun/moon sizes in gradient sky, and corrected moonbow direction.
* Fixed emissive-surface cloud lighting, added a safe fallback for unknown tagged translucent blocks, removed the empty translation submenu, made TAA default-off as a standard user toggle, and synced waving vegetation displacement in the shadow pass.
* Forced vanilla Minecraft clouds off via `clouds=false` and added `gbuffers_clouds` discard shaders as a fallback, so AuraLite's procedural clouds do not overlap with default clouds.
* Added `gbuffers_weather` to make vanilla rain/snow streaks less dense and more transparent by default.
* Added explicit opaque entity/hand passes to prevent players, mobs and held items from appearing semi-transparent.
* Restored the v1.0.5-style water surface pipeline with a hybrid detector: depth-difference compatibility for strong reflections, plus glass/ice rejection when reliable material data is present.

## 🆕 What's New in v1.1.0 — *True Volumetric Godrays, HDR Pipeline & Experimental Physical Sky*

Version **1.1.0** replaces the screen-space godray approximation with a fully volumetric raymarched implementation, switches the entire G-buffer pipeline to true HDR (RGBA16F), and introduces an experimental, fully physical realtime atmospheric-scattering sky mode as an opt-in alternative to the stable gradient sky. This is a focused two-pillar update on top of the **v1.0.7** bug-fix baseline.

### 🌤️ True Volumetric Godrays

The old `computeGodrays()` screen-space approximation has been replaced by `computeVolumetricGodrays()` — a genuine single-scattering volumetric raymarch:

* **Per-step shadow-map occlusion** — every raymarch sample now tests the shadow map individually, so light shafts are actually carved by real geometry (trees, buildings, cave ceilings) instead of being implied by a "forward-looking boost" toward the sun.
* **Interleaved Gradient Noise dithering** (Jimenez 2014), rotated per-frame via the new `frameCounter` uniform when TAA is active — 8–24 raymarch steps now integrate as smoothly as hundreds, with no banding.
* **Exact per-segment Beer–Lambert integration** — `Tr₀ · σs/σt · (1 − e^(−σt·Δx))` per step, which is energy-conserving regardless of step size (no more over-brightening at low sample counts).
* **Dual-lobe Henyey-Greenstein phase function** (forward + weak backscatter lobe) with an isotropic floor, so crepuscular rays stay visible when looking *across* them, not only when staring directly at the sun.
* **Colored radiance** — shafts are now warm Kelvin-driven sunbeams by day, deep orange at sunset, and faint blue moonbeams at night, instead of a flat white/yellow overlay.
* **New `GODRAYS_STRENGTH`** setting (*Subtle / Balanced / Dramatic*) added to every quality profile.
* `GODRAYS_QUALITY` sample counts and distances increased: Fast 8 samples/96m, Balanced 16/128m, High 24/160m (up from 4/72m, 6/110m, 8/150m in v1.0.7).

### 🌈 Full HDR G-Buffer Pipeline

* **`colortex0`, `colortex1`, and `colortex2` are now explicitly `RGBA16F`.** Bright sources — the sun disk, lava, specular highlights, portals — no longer clip to `1.0` before tone mapping, so the ACES/AgX curves in `final.fsh` finally compress genuine HDR highlights instead of receiving pre-clamped input. Bloom now samples real HDR luminance rather than an already-saturated LDR buffer.
* `colortex2`'s alpha channel carries a 5-value material tag (`0.0`/`0.1`/`0.62`/`0.8`/`1.0`); RGBA16F guarantees these are preserved exactly, whereas a lower-precision format would have aliased and collided material tags (e.g. foliage vs. water).
* Godray intensity constants were re-tuned (roughly halved vs. the old LDR values) now that the additive shaft survives in full instead of clipping against a saturated scene; a stronger soft shoulder (`0.50` vs. the old `0.30`) keeps the sun-facing core from blowing out under HDR.

### 🧪 Experimental: Realtime Physical Sky (Off by Default)

A brand-new **`[EXPERIMENTAL]`** menu tab exposes an alternate sky renderer in `gbuffers_skybasic.fsh`, disabled in every shipped profile (`SKY_MODE=0`) so the stable gradient sky remains the default:

* **`SKY_MODE`** — `0` (Gradient, legacy v1.0.7-style sky) or `1` (Physical Realtime): a genuine per-pixel ray-marched atmosphere with exact 1st-order single scattering (Rayleigh + Mie + Ozone, full sun-ray optical-depth march with ground-occlusion detection) plus a blue-biased, bounded multiple-scattering ambient term that fills in the zenith/horizon without producing the typical LUT-based "yellow band" artifact. No lookup textures, no cross-frame reads.
* **`SKY_QUALITY`** — controls raymarch sample counts (*Fast 8×4 / Standard 12×6 / High 16×8*) for the physical mode.
* **`SKY_STYLE`** — new artistic-direction toggle independent of `SKY_MODE`: *Realistic* (true angular sun/moon size, neutral colors, minimal glow — an authentic astronomy look), *Semi-realistic* (readable ×2.8 sun/moon size, richer color, soft aureole — the default), or *Fantasy* (grand ×5.5 sun/moon, huge corona, vivid saturated teal/crimson/indigo palette for a stylized sky).
* Physical mode renders the sun disk with real limb darkening and a physically-derived angular radius, and computes its color from actual sun-ray transmittance (ozone-aware) rather than the legacy Kelvin/airmass approximation.
* Because this feature is explicitly experimental and disabled by default, it introduces no behavioral change to any existing profile.

### 🛠️ Smaller Fixes & Cleanup

* **Dark-sky/moon-halo banding fixed at the source** — a linear-space triangle-distributed dither (`±1/255`, matching the BSL/Complementary technique) is now applied in `final.fsh` *before* tone mapping, where gamma expansion makes a tiny linear noise term large enough in the darks to smooth the gradient, while staying invisible in bright regions. The old post-gamma dither (which couldn't fix pre-tonemap banding) has been removed and replaced with an explicit final `clamp()`.
* `shadow.vsh` no longer relies on the deprecated fixed-function `ftransform()`; it now builds the clip-space position explicitly via `gl_ModelViewMatrix` / `gl_ProjectionMatrix` for broader driver compatibility.
* Updated localization strings for `GODRAYS`, `GODRAYS_QUALITY`, and the new `GODRAYS_STRENGTH` / `SKY_MODE` / `SKY_STYLE` / `SKY_QUALITY` options and the new Experimental tab.

## 🆕 What's New in v1.0.7 — _Comprehensive Bug Fix, Stability & Aurora Refinement Update_

Version **1.0.7** conducts a deep code audit across the entire GLSL 460 pipeline to resolve rendering anomalies, feedback loops, and multi-pass inconsistencies introduced in earlier releases, and additionally refines the Aurora Borealis to remove high-frequency visual noise while softening its overall luminance.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes & Architectural Polish

*   **Massive Volumetric Cloud, Godray & Aurora FPS Bottleneck Resolved**
*   **Underwater Screen-Space Ripple Distortion Feedback Loop Fixed** — Removed legacy underwater ripple screen distortion from `composite.fsh` (where it erroneously sampled raw unlit G-buffer albedo `colortex0` and mixed unshaded texels into the lit scene). Moved clean underwater screen-space view perturbation directly into `final.fsh`, sampling the fully lit, composited, and TAA-resolved scene.
*   **Glass & Ice Water Refraction / Reflection Distortion Fixed** — Solved a multi-target G-buffer collision where stained glass windows and ice blocks triggered the depth-comparison detector `(depthS - depth) > 1e-5` in `final.fsh`. Added a dedicated material alpha tag `colortex2.a = 0.8` for water in `gbuffers_water` and `gbuffers_terrain_translucent`, ensuring glass windows (`1.0`) and ice blocks (`1.0`) never receive underwater refraction ripples or wavy water SSR reflections.
*   **Procedural Lava POM Coordinate Discard Fixed** — Standardized the 4-step Parallax Occlusion Mapping loop in `gbuffers_water.fsh` and `gbuffers_terrain_translucent.fsh` to match `gbuffers_terrain.fsh`. Displaced UV coordinates `p = currentTexCoords` are now properly retained across the entire shader block for crack height calculations, temperature gradients, hotspots, and rising bubbles.
*   **Unnormalized Lava Normal Output Fixed** — Normalized the G-buffer normal output `normalize(normal)` in `gbuffers_terrain.fsh` before encoding into `colortex2`, preventing interpolated vector length drift across triangle interiors.
*   **Camera-Inside Volumetric Fog, Ground Mist & Valley Sheets Fixed** — In `getInsideGroundMistVeil()`, `applyInsideCloudVeil()`, and distant ground mist sheet rendering, fixed the exponential absorption rate (lowered from `0.014`/`0.0105` to `0.0018`/`0.0035`) and removed hardcoded blanket opacity ceilings (`0.30`/`0.34`). Wired the user's `FOG_DENSITY_LEVEL` setting directly into volume optical thickness. Added a smooth attenuation factor `(1.0 - camMistHere * 0.95)` to distant 2D sheets when standing inside the ground mist layer, preventing double-accumulation with the screen-space volumetric veil.
*   **PCSS Blocker Search Self-Shadow Acne Fixed** — Updated the blocker depth comparison threshold in `composite.fsh` from a static `1e-4` epsilon to the dynamic surface slope bias (`bias`). Sloped terrain no longer detects itself as a false shadow occluder.
*   **POM Division-By-Zero NaN Fixed** — In `getParallaxCoords()`, changed the ray hit weight denominator from `(afterDepth - beforeDepth + 0.0001)` to `min(afterDepth - beforeDepth, -1e-5)`. Since `afterDepth - beforeDepth` is strictly negative, adding `+0.0001` mathematically cancelled out the denominator to zero on subtle step transitions, causing black dot NaN artifacts.
*   **POM Optical View Angle Cotangent Scaling & Limiting Added** — Scaled tangent-space UV step offsets by `V_tang.xy / max(abs(V_tang.z), 0.15)` across all POM passes. Parallax crack depth now physically stretches when viewed at grazing angles instead of flattening out.
*   **Procedural Lava Sub-Step POM Linear Interpolation Added** — Replaced the discrete sub-step endpoint `p = currentTexCoords` in the lava POM loop with exact linear interpolation `mix(currentTexCoords, prevTexCoords, weight)`. Internal crack walls no longer suffer from 4-step banding/stepping artifacts.
*   **Block Mapping Extended** — Added `minecraft:magma_block` to block ID `10009` in `block.properties`, granting overworld and nether magma blocks dynamic procedural glowing Voronoi cracks.

### 🌌 Aurora Borealis Refinement — Smoother & Softer

The volumetric Aurora in `gbuffers_skybasic.fsh` was producing subtle high-frequency "static" patterns and reading slightly oversaturated on bright presets. The shader pass has been retuned in this release:

*   **Dither offset re-centered and weakened** — Replaced the `0..1` per-pixel ray start offset with a centered `-0.5..+0.5` range scaled down to `0.6 × dt`. Adjacent pixels now sample closer ray distances, eliminating the flickering pattern that read as visual noise.
*   **Vertical ray frequency lowered (32.0 → 14.0)** — The single very-high-frequency `sin(uv.x × 32)` that powered the striations aliased into thin static-like lines. Two slightly offset waves (`14.0` + `9.0`) are now blended together with `mix(0.5)` to break the periodic aliasing while preserving the characteristic vertical pillar look.
*   **Ray sharpness softened (3.0 → 1.8) and amplitude reduced (2.0 → 1.3)** — Pillars no longer have harsh, sharp edges; they blend smoothly into the curtain ribbon.
*   **Curtain ribbon exponent softened (5.0 → 3.5)** and weight lowered from `0.5` to `0.45` — Lighter, more atmospheric curtains without the blocky stripe artifacts the high power was producing.
*   **Spatial color variation slowed down** — `sin(worldDir.x × 3.5 + worldDir.z × 2.8) × 0.2` → `sin(worldDir.x × 2.2 + worldDir.z × 1.7) × 0.18`. Color shifts across the sky are now gradual instead of rapid.
*   **Photographic palette toned down (~30% dimmer)**:
    *   Cyan-Green: `(0.0, 0.80, 0.50)` → `(0.0, 0.55, 0.32)`
    *   Magenta/Purple: `(0.60, 0.10, 0.70)` → `(0.42, 0.08, 0.50)`
    *   Deep Blue (upper edge): `(0.05, 0.10, 0.50)` → `(0.04, 0.08, 0.35)`
*   **Optical depth scaling lowered (0.35 → 0.26)** and final intensity multiplier `× 0.78` — Overall accumulation is roughly **35–40% softer** than the v1.0.7 original. The `AURORA_STRENGTH` profile setting still controls user-level intensity on top.

The aurora now reads as a soft, glowing, photographic northern light rather than an over-saturated neon stripe pattern. No menu changes; no new options; no profile changes. All existing `AURORA_MODE`, `AURORA_SPEED`, and `AURORA_STRENGTH` settings behave as before.

## 🆕 What's New in v1.0.6 — _Procedural Lava & Heat Shimmer_

Version **1.0.6** adds a physically-inspired procedural lava block renderer and a subtle heat-shimmer post-processing effect. It is a focused visual update on top of **v1.0.5**.

### 🔥 Procedural Lava / Magma (Block ID 10009)

*   **Block mapping** — `minecraft:lava` and `minecraft:flowing_lava` are now tagged with block ID `10009` in `block.properties`.
*   **3D Voronoi cracks** — the surface is generated with a procedural Voronoi crack field (basalt crust on top, glowing magma in the cracks) using a 4-step parallax occlusion raymarch for real depth.
*   **Animated convection flow** — slow noise-driven convection makes the magma crawl and pulse.
*   **Localized hot spots & bubbles** — rare high-contrast yellow-orange hot spots and short-lived rising bubbles add life without turning the surface into noise.
*   **Viscous waves** — only the top face receives a slower, heavier vertex displacement so lava feels thick and molten.
*   **PBR-ready** — the basalt crust is rough (0.95) while the magma cracks are extremely glossy (0.02), giving physically plausible highlights.
*   **Multi-pass coverage** — lava is handled in `gbuffers_terrain`, `gbuffers_water`, and `gbuffers_terrain_translucent` so it renders correctly on both Iris and Oculus pipelines regardless of which pass the loader assigns fluid blocks to.

### 🌡️ Heat Shimmer Above Lava

*   `final.fsh` detects lava pixels through a dedicated `colortex2` alpha signature (0.1) and applies a subtle, slow screen-space distortion that simulates rising hot air.
*   The effect is constrained by depth and by the lava mask, so it only affects pixels directly above or next to lava surfaces.
*   **New in-game options:** `HEAT_SHIMMER` (on/off) and `HEAT_SHIMMER_STRENGTH` (Subtle / Balanced / Strong), located in the `[Post-Processing & Fog]` menu.

## 🆕 What's New in v1.0.5 — _Expanded Localization_

Version **1.0.5** is a localization-focused release that adds **10 new in-game languages**, bringing the total to **69 supported locales**. No shader logic, profile defaults, or rendering behavior was changed — this is a pure translation / metadata update on top of **v1.0.4**.

### 🌐 New Languages

The following fully-translated `.lang` files were added (every option name, value label, profile name and tooltip — 289 keys each, 100% key parity with the English source):

| Code  |Language        |Code  |Language              |
| ----- |--------------- |----- |--------------------- |
| <code>gl_es</code> |Galician        |<code>sw_ke</code> |Swahili               |
| <code>ga_ie</code> |Irish           |<code>nn_no</code> |Norwegian Nynorsk     |

| <code>az_az</code> |Azerbaijani     |<code>zh_hk</code> |Cantonese (Hong Kong) |

*   As with all non-English locales, the in-game **⚠ Translations may contain errors** notice applies — some strings in rarer languages may be imperfect; compare with the English original if anything looks off.
*   No shader logic, profile defaults, or rendering behavior changed in this release — **v1.0.5** is purely a localization / metadata refresh on top of **v1.0.4**.
*   `README.md`, installation references, and source-folder notes updated to **v1.0.5**.
*   `shaders.properties` and `block.properties` metadata headers updated to **v1.0.5**.
*   Source-folder snapshots now run through `shaders v1.0.5/`.

## 🆕 What's New in v1.0.4 — _Profile Rebalance, Translucent Blocks & Glass Rendering_

Version **1.0.4** delivers a full quality-profile rebalance for smoother progression, introduces proper translucent block rendering for ice and glass, adds a dedicated Iris/Oculus translucent terrain pass, and fixes a cross-vendor GLSL compatibility issue.

### 🔄 Full Profile Rebalance

All six quality profiles (VERY\_LOW → EXTREME) have been rebalanced for a smoother, more logical feature progression:

| Profile  |Key Changes in v1.0.4                                                                                                                                           |
| -------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <strong>VERY_LOW</strong> |Sun intensity lowered to <em>Dim</em> (1), underwater night set to <em>Moonlit Pool</em> for visibility.                                                        |
| <strong>LOW</strong> |Ambient brightness lowered, cozy lights disabled, Filmic tone mapping (ACES), underwater night set to <em>Dim</em>. Stars upgraded to <em>Standard</em>.        |
| <strong>MED</strong> |Godrays now <strong>enabled</strong> (Fast quality) — this was the biggest missing piece in the sweet-spot preset. PBR strength raised to <em>Standard</em>. Meteor frequency normalized. |
| <strong>HIGH</strong> |SSAO now <strong>enabled</strong> (Subtle) — contact shadows appear at this tier. Godrays bumped to <em>Balanced</em>. Moon intensity lowered to <em>Standard</em>. |
| <strong>ULTRA</strong> |Godrays raised to <em>High</em>. TAA strength at <em>Balanced</em>.                                                                                             |
| <strong>EXTREME</strong> |Water wave scale pushed to <em>Stormy</em>. Underwater night set to <em>Pitch Dark</em> for maximum survival realism. Photographic (AgX) tone mapping.          |

### 🧊 Split Ice & Glass Block Rendering

*   **Regular ice** (`minecraft:ice`, block ID 10005) now renders with its actual texture and semi-transparency instead of being fully opaque. Transparency scales with the `WATER_TRANSPARENCY` setting (Clear / Balanced / Deep).
*   **Packed ice, blue ice, and frosted ice** (block ID 10007) are now rendered **opaque with texture** — distinct from regular ice so the visual difference is clear.
*   **All glass blocks and panes** (block ID 10008), including every stained-glass variant and tinted glass, now render with their actual texture and proper transparency. Glass opacity scales with `WATER_TRANSPARENCY`. This eliminates the old "invisible glass" problem where glass blocks disappeared against bright skies.
*   Both ice types and glass are handled by the new `gbuffers_terrain_translucent` pass, ensuring correct rendering on Iris/Oculus split-translucent pipelines.

### 🪟 New Translucent Terrain Pass (`gbuffers_terrain_translucent`)

*   A new **`gbuffers_terrain_translucent.fsh` / `.vsh`** shader pair was added. This pass handles water, ice, glass, and nether-portal blocks in a single Iris/Oculus-compatible translucent terrain path.
*   Mirrors the existing `gbuffers_water.fsh` logic so translucent blocks render identically regardless of whether the loader uses a unified or split translucent G-buffer path.
*   Nether portal plasma, ice Fresnel, glass opacity, and water Fresnel/ripples all route through this pass.

### 🛠️ GLSL Compatibility Fix

*   **Replaced all `fma()` calls with direct multiply-add expressions** across every shader file. The `fma()` intrinsic, while correct on most modern GPUs, caused compilation failures on certain drivers (particularly older Intel iGPUs and some Mesa versions). The replacement `a * b + c` expressions are mathematically equivalent and compile universally.

***

## 🆕 What's New in v1.0.3 — _Anti-Aliasing & PBR Performance_

Version **1.0.3** adds configurable spatial anti-aliasing (FXAA / SMAA) and a PBR render distance control that skips expensive Cook-Torrance specular calculations on distant terrain.

### 🖼️ Spatial Anti-Aliasing (FXAA / SMAA)

*   **`SPATIAL_AA_MODE`** — new toggle in the `[Post-Processing]` menu with 3 modes:
    *   **Off** — no spatial AA (TAA-only or nothing).
    *   **FXAA** — Fast Approximate AA. Sobel gradient-directed edge detection with conservative blend weights. Cheap and effective.
    *   **SMAA** — Subpixel Morphological AA. Combines luminance Sobel gradient with depth discontinuity detection for superior edge detection on geometry where luma contrast is low. Slightly more expensive than FXAA.
*   Both modes operate in linear space before tone mapping and are conservative enough to avoid washing out the image (max blend weight 0.15–0.18, high edge thresholds).
*   Freely combinable with TAA (composite1 pass) for temporal + spatial smoothing.
*   Added to all 6 quality profiles: VERY\_LOW=Off, LOW/MED=FXAA, HIGH/ULTRA/EXTREME=SMAA.

### ⚡ PBR Render Distance

*   **`PBR_DISTANCE`** — new setting in the `[Lighting Settings]` menu with 4 levels:
    *   **Near (16m)** — PBR specular only on very close surfaces. Maximum GPU savings.
    *   **Standard (48m)** — balanced distance. Default for LOW/MED profiles.
    *   **Far (128m)** — extended range. Default for HIGH/ULTRA profiles.
    *   **Unlimited** — no distance limit. EXTREME profile only.
*   Beyond the fade range, the entire Cook-Torrance BRDF block (GGX distribution, Smith geometry, Fresnel-Schlick) is **completely skipped** via early-out — no wasted ALU on sub-pixel specular.
*   Fade is smooth (`smoothstep` between start and end distance) to avoid visible pop-in.

### 🌐 Localization

*   Full English and Russian localization for both new settings (option names + value labels).
*   Other language files fall back to English labels.

***

### 🌿 Foliage Subsurface Scattering (also finalized in v1.0.3)

*   **`FOLIAGE_SSS`** — toggle in the `[Foliage Settings]` menu. Enables light bleeding through leaves and plants when looking toward the sun, plus a soft wrap term for the shaded side. Controlled per-profile (enabled from MED upward by default). Uses material ID tagging in `gbuffers_terrain` and a dedicated SSS pass in `composite.fsh`.
*   Added to all quality profiles (VERY\_LOW → EXTREME) with the `!FOLIAGE_SSS` or `FOLIAGE_SSS` flag.
*   Full English + Russian localization strings added.

older changelog sections below are preserved as original release notes.

Version **1.0.2** adds realistic subsurface scattering for vegetation, making leaves, grass, and plants look more translucent and lifelike when light shines through them. This is a focused visual enhancement that integrates cleanly with the existing PBR and lighting pipeline.

### 🌿 New Feature

*   **Foliage Subsurface Scattering (`FOLIAGE_SSS`)** — New toggle in the `[Foliage Settings]` menu. When enabled, foliage receives additional lighting from the back (light bleeding) and a soft wrap term for the unlit side. Controlled per-profile (enabled from MED upward by default). Uses material ID tagging in `gbuffers_terrain` and a dedicated SSS pass in `composite.fsh`.
*   Added to all quality profiles (VERY\_LOW → EXTREME) with the `!FOLIAGE_SSS` or `FOLIAGE_SSS` flag.
*   Full English + Russian localization strings added.

## 🆕 What's New in v1.0.1 — _Stability, HDR Bloom & Photographic Tone Mapping_

Version **1.0.1** is a focused hotfix on top of v1.0.0 that addresses five edge-case rendering issues and introduces a new cinematic tone-mapping curve with lightweight HDR bloom.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

*   **TAA history acceptance threshold.** Added `historySample.a < 0.99` guard in `composite1.fsh` so uninitialised or stale history buffers (e.g. right after shader reload or resolution change) are rejected instead of causing ghosting.
*   **Vibrancy math.** `applyVibrancy` in `final.fsh` now correctly handles negative saturation values — oversaturation works as intended rather than relying on undefined GLSL `mix` extrapolation followed by hard clamping.
*   **SSR normal NaN guard.** Added `length(N) > 0.5` check before `traceSSR()` so invalid normals from edge pixels are silently skipped instead of producing black reflections.
*   **SSR near-field trace precision.** Minimum raymarch step lowered from `1.0` to `0.3` view-space units, dramatically improving hit rate on close surfaces (ripples, shallow pools, wet stone).
*   **Meteor moon-brightness curve.** `gbuffers_skybasic.fsh` now uses `cos²(phase × π/8)` — identical to `getMoonPhaseBrightness()` in `composite.fsh` — so moon washout is physically consistent.

### 🎨 Visual Enhancements

*   **HDR Bloom _(v1.0.1)_.** Cheap single-pass 3×3 neighbour blur for overbright pixels (luminance threshold 0.75). Naturally affects sun/moon disks, lava, portals, bright specular highlights, and torches — without smearing the entire scene or requiring extra render targets.
*   **Photographic (AgX-like) Tone Mapping _(v1.0.1)_.** A new `CONTRAST = 4` option in `final.fsh` provides a sigmoidal tone curve with natural highlight chromatic attenuation, soft toe, and lifted blacks — giving a cinematic, non-clipped look that keeps foliage saturation under control while handling extreme brightness gracefully.
*   **EXTREME profile updated.** Now uses `CONTRAST=4` (Photographic/AgX-like) instead of `CONTRAST=3` for cinematic highlight handling.

## 🆕 What's New in v1.0.0 — _Meteor Showers & Finalized Reflection Pipeline_

Version **1.0.0** builds on the volumetric aurora work from v0.3.0 and introduces the first **v1.0.0** source snapshot in this repository. The update adds a physically-inspired meteor system to the night sky, finalizes the modern SSR path for reliable Iris compatibility, and refreshes the documentation so the project now correctly points to the `shaders v1.0.0/` folder.

### ☄️ Physically-Based Meteors / Falling Stars

*   **True great-circle sky arcs.** Meteors are rendered as moving arcs on the celestial sphere instead of flat 2D streaks, so showers converge toward a shared radiant like real meteor photography.
*   **Ablation-based brightness curve.** Each meteor rises, peaks, and fades with a bell-shaped light curve inspired by atmospheric entry.
*   **Blackbody plasma colouring.** Meteor heads are tinted with the same Kelvin-based colour pipeline used by AuraLite's sun/moon lighting, giving physically consistent warm-to-white fireball tones.
*   **Moonlight washout and weather attenuation.** Faint meteors are suppressed by bright moon phases, rain, and daytime sky brightness, improving realism and avoiding visual clutter in poor visibility.
*   **Persistent trains on bright fireballs.** The strongest events leave a short-lived glowing ionization trail, including a subtle green oxygen-style tint on the lingering train.
*   **Available in both Overworld and The End.** Overworld meteors respect moonlight and atmosphere; End meteors render against the permanent night sky without moon washout.

### 🪞 Finalized v1.0.0 SSR / Water Reflection Path

*   **`colortex6` fully removed from the reflection workflow.** The older MRT export path was retired; `final.fsh` now reads normals directly from `colortex2` and roughness from `colortex1`, matching AuraLite's already-working PBR data path.
*   **Depth-based water-surface detection.** Water is identified by comparing `depthtex0` and `depthtex1`, making reflections robust on Iris paths where water G-buffer writes may be inconsistent.
*   **More stable water normals.** Reflection normals are reconstructed from neighbouring depth samples and then perturbed with coherent world-space ripple gradients, reducing faceting and torn reflections.
*   **Cleaner post-pass reliability.** The reflection pipeline now lives entirely in the final post-processing pass, simplifying the frame graph and avoiding loader-specific MRT issues.

### 🎛️ New Sky Settings & Profile Integration

*   New configurable options: **`SHOOTING_STARS`**, **`SHOOTING_STARS_FREQUENCY`**, and **`SHOOTING_STARS_BRIGHTNESS`**.
*   Shooting stars are disabled on the lightest presets and enabled from **MED** upward through the normal profile system.
*   English and Russian UI text was expanded for the new night-sky controls, while other language files continue to fall back safely.

## 🆕 What's New in v0.3.0 — _Volumetric Aurora Realism Update_

Version **0.3.0** focuses on the night sky and replaces the older flat aurora overlay with a more photographic, volumetric aurora renderer. The rest of the rendering pipeline remains based on the stable v0.2.9 SSR/water foundation.

### 🌌 Realistic Volumetric Aurora Borealis

*   **Raymarched aurora curtains.** Aurora rendering now samples a vertical volume above the horizon instead of drawing a simple 2D noise layer, giving the effect visible depth and height.
*   **Distinct vertical pillars and rays.** Fine high-frequency striations create the characteristic upward beams seen in real aurora photography.
*   **Sharper lower edge, softer upper fade.** The aurora now has a defined luminous base and gradually dissolves into the upper night sky.
*   **More vivid photographic colours.** The palette was rebalanced toward saturated cyan-green, magenta/purple, and subtle deep-blue upper blending.
*   **Better motion pacing.** Animation speed was reduced and smoothed so curtains drift naturally instead of sliding too quickly across the sky.
*   **Preserved biome/weather logic.** Existing `AURORA_MODE`, cold-biome detection, rain attenuation, speed, and brightness settings continue to work.

## 🆕 What's New in v0.2.9 — _Working SSR, Realistic Waves & True Night Underwater_

Version **0.2.9** is a focused water-quality update that finally delivers the long-requested **screen-space reflections** that work on every loader (including the tricky Iris 1.20+ pipeline), introduces **physically-coherent procedural waves** that don't tear reflections, and gives underwater scenes **true nocturnal darkness**.

### 🪞 Screen-Space Reflections (SSR) — Now Actually Working

*   **Loader-agnostic SSR pipeline.** Previous SSR implementations relied on multi-render-target writes via `DRAWBUFFERS:06` + `layout(location = 1) out`. This combination silently failed on Iris 1.20 — the second attachment was never bound to the FBO, so reflection data was lost between the composite and final passes. v0.2.9 reads the surface normal directly from `colortex2` and roughness from `colortex1.z` (the same buffers PBR specular highlights already use), bypassing the broken MRT path entirely.
    
*   **Bulletproof water detector.** Water surfaces are now identified by comparing `depthtex0` (depth _with_ translucents) and `depthtex1` (depth _without_ translucents). When they differ, the pixel is a water/glass/ice surface — no false positives on lapis lazuli, blue wool, packed ice, or terrain seen through water. Works regardless of whether `gbuffers_water` correctly writes its G-buffer attachments.
    
*   **dFdx-stabilized normal reconstruction.** For pixels where `gbufferModelView` is identity in the final pass (a known Iris quirk), the water normal is rebuilt from depth-buffer derivatives using a 4-tap central-difference kernel. The result is the _true geometric normal_ of the visible water surface, independent of any matrix uniforms.
    
*   **Schlick-correct Fresnel.** Reflections now follow the physical F0 = 0.02 dielectric water curve: weak when looking straight down, near-mirror at grazing angles.
    
*   **Adaptive view-space raymarcher with binary refinement.** Textbook real-time SSR: the reflected ray is marched in view space with a step length that scales with the current depth gap (long jumps in empty space, short jumps near the surface), then refined with 4–7 binary-search iterations once a crossing is detected. Distance-aware tolerance prevents Z-fighting on far samples. 14 / 24 / 40 march steps depending on `SSR_QUALITY`.
    

### 🌊 Coherent Procedural Wave System

*   **4-octave fBm height-field** with C2-continuous quintic smoothing. Each octave is rotated ~33° to break grid alignment.
*   **Analytic gradients** (4-sample central differences in world space) produce _coherent_ wave slopes — reflections smoothly track wave geometry instead of jittering as random noise offsets did in earlier prototypes.
*   New **`WATER_WAVE_SCALE`** menu setting: _Calm / Standard / Choppy / Stormy_ — controls wave amplitude from mirror to broken horizon.
*   New **`WATER_WAVE_DETAIL`** menu setting: _Coarse / Standard / Dense_ — controls wave frequency from a few large swells to many fine ripples.

### 🌑 True Underwater Night Darkness

*   The old underwater scattering formula had three baked-in brightness floors (`+0.25` on `dayFactor`, `+0.3` on `skyLight`, plus a constant deep-water blue tint), so even pitch-black midnight underwater looked like a moonlit pool. v0.2.9 rebuilds the formula to honour the actual day/night cycle.
*   New **`UNDERWATER_NIGHT_DARKNESS`** menu setting:
    *   **Moonlit Pool** — original 0.2.8 brightness (compat mode)
    *   **Dim** — clearly night, still visible
    *   **True Night** — realistic darkness (default)
    *   **Pitch Dark** — extreme survival realism

### 🛠️ Smaller fixes

*   Removed the unused `colortex6Out` MRT write from `composite.fsh` along with its `colortex6Format` declaration — fewer attachments, simpler pipeline, less to break.
*   Centralized SSR/wave/underwater toggles into the regular profile system, so all six presets (VERY\_LOW → EXTREME) carry sensible defaults.
*   Added English and Russian translations for all new options, plus value-label localization (`Calm`/`Choppy`/`True Night` etc.) — other languages fall back to English labels.

## ✨ Features At A Glance

### ☁️ 1. Meteorological 3D Volumetric Clouds (Fly-Through!)

AuraLite features a fully physical, flyable 3D cloud system driven by **12-step Raymarching** in world coordinates:

*   **True 3D Space:** Clouds float at a physical height (configurable base altitude). You can fly up, enter a dense, foggy overcast, and rise above the clouds to see an endless rolling sea of fluffy cumulus clouds.
*   **Camera-Inside-Cloud Veil** _(v0.2.5)_: When flying inside the cloud layer, a soft volumetric white/grey fog surrounds the camera.
*   **Independent Wind-Shear Layers** _(v0.2.5)_: Each cloud layer (Cirrus, Altocumulus, Altostratus, Cumulus) moves on its own rotated/sheared domain with the `WIND_SPEED` setting.
*   **Cloud Render Distance** _(v0.2.5)_: New 4-step control (_Near / Standard / Far / Very Far_) — from 3 000 m to 16 000 m horizon-scale decks.
*   **Beer's Law Self-Shadowing:** Realistic light absorption makes cloud bottoms dense and dark while cloud tops glow with brilliant white/gold illumination.
*   **Mie Scattering (Silver Lining):** Looking towards the sun produces a glowing golden halo around the cloud edges.
*   **Overcast Storms:** When raining (`/weather rain`), the fluffy cumulus clouds automatically expand, darken, and merge into an ominous, heavy **Nimbostratus/Cumulonimbus** storm deck.

### 🌠 2. Living Night Sky _(since v0.2.0)_

The night sky is no longer just a static starfield — it's a fully procedural cosmos:

*   **Aurora Borealis:** Realistic, flowing northern lights that ripple across the upper sky. Modes: _Disabled / Only in Cold Biomes / Always Enabled_, with independent **speed** and **brightness** controls. _(v0.2.5: rendered in `gbuffers_skybasic` for reliability; cold-biome detection uses real biome uniforms. v1.0.7: tone softened and high-frequency noise removed — read as a photographic glow rather than oversaturated neon.)_
*   **Milky Way Nebula:** A subtle diagonal brownish galactic band glows softly above the horizon, with adjustable brightness.
*   **Procedural Stars:** Independent **brightness** and **density** sliders let you choose between a few crisp pinpricks or a brilliantly dense Hubble-style sky. Stars sparkle and twinkle in real time.
*   **Physically-Based Meteors / Falling Stars** _(v1.0.0)_: configurable meteor activity, brightness, moon washout, and persistent ionization trails bring realistic night-sky streaks to the Overworld and the End.
*   **Persistent Rainbow:** After rain stops, a soft rainbow arcs across the sky and gently fades out as the `wetness` uniform decays. Brightness and saturation are configurable.

### ☀️ 3. Analytical Kelvin Sun & Moon — _Enhanced in v0.2.2, refined in v0.2.5_

*   **Tanner Helland Blackbody Sun:** Sunlight color temperature is dynamically calculated in real time based on the sun's elevation angle using a physically-correct **blackbody Kelvin curve** (selectable: _Cool / Realistic / Warm Golden_). This yields photoreal sunrise/sunset colors (~1800K–2200K), warm golden hours (~2800K), and clean crisp white noon light (~5700K–5800K).
*   **Beer-Lambert Atmospheric Extinction:** Sunlight intensity dynamically drops as the sun approaches the horizon due to scattering in thick atmospheric masses: $airMass = \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\alpha) + 0.15 \\cdot (\\alpha\_{deg} + 3.885)^{-1.253}}$ This yields incredibly soft, rich, and breathtaking sunset and sunrise golden hour transitions!
*   **Independent Sun & Moon Intensity** _(v0.2.2)_: 4-step master sliders let you push the day brighter (_Blazing_) or sink nights into total darkness (_Pitch Night_).
*   **Moon Color Temperature** _(v0.2.2)_: choose between _Icy Blue_ (cold), _Silver_ (physically accurate 4100K), or _Warm Cream_ (harvest-moon).
*   **Sun Halo (Mie forward-scatter)** & **Enhanced Sunrise/Sunset Glow** _(v0.2.2)_ — warm scattering effects on terrain when looking near the low sun.
*   🆕 **Extended Twilight Window** _(v0.2.5)_: Sunset/sunrise lighting stays warm/red at `/time set 12800` instead of snapping to neutral.
*   **Crispy Circular Sun & Moon Disks:** Custom procedural, perfectly round, anti-aliased sun and moon disks are drawn onto the sky dome with glowing coronas and soft halo scattering.

### 👥 4. Soft Shadows, Immersive Dark Nights & Cozy Lights — _Enhanced in v0.2.2, refined in v0.2.5_

*   **Rotated Poisson Disk Soft Shadows** _(v0.2.2)_: replaces the old fixed 3×3 PCF kernel. Three quality steps — _Sharp / Soft / Ultra Soft_ — give natural-looking penumbra on shadow maps up to 4096×4096.
*   🆕 **Shadow Slope Bias Fix** _(v0.2.5)_: bias now uses raw NdotL to prevent acne artifacts.
*   **Shadow Distance Control** _(v0.2.2)_: cap dynamic shadow rendering at _60m / 80m / 120m / 160m_ for performance or quality tuning.
*   **Shadow Tint** _(v0.2.2)_: realistic cool-blue tint for daytime shadows under an open sky (or neutral / warm if you prefer).
*   **Ambient Lift** _(v0.2.2)_: control how dark shadowed areas appear at night and in caves.
*   **Light Wrap (Terminator Softness)** _(v0.2.2)_: choose physical Lambert, a soft photographic wrap, or a stylized look. _(v0.2.5: all profiles default to realistic Lambert.)_
*   🆕 **SSAO / SAO Contact Ambient Occlusion** _(v0.2.5)_: screen-space darkening in corners and at geometry intersections. Enabled on ULTRA+ profiles.
*   **Deep Dark Nights (2× darker):** Night ambient light, moonlight intensity, and fog are reduced by 2× by default to create incredibly atmospheric, immersive nights. Caves and forests are pitch dark, requiring torches for exploration (combine with the new _Pitch Night_ moon preset for extra spice).
*   **Warm Block Lights:** Torches, lanterns, and lava emit a cozy golden-amber glow with physically accurate quadratic falloff.
*   🕯️ **Cozy Torch Flickering** _(since v0.2.0)_: Real-time flickering animations for torches, campfires, and lanterns add a living, warm atmosphere to your shelters. Held-item light contribution (`heldBlockLightValue`) is also accounted for.

### 🌊 5. Physical Fresnel Water & Silver Moonlight Path — _Refined in v0.2.5_

*   **Fresnel Effect:** Water reflectivity is mathematically calculated based on your viewing angle. Looking straight down provides crystal transparency, while looking towards the horizon transitions water into a highly reflective, glossy sheet reflecting the sky dome.
*   **Silver Moonlight Path:** Moonlight specular reflection on water ripples has been increased by **4.5×**. At midnight, a brilliant silver lunar reflection path shimmers across the waving ocean.
*   🆕 **Unified GGX PBR Water Specular** _(v0.2.5)_: Water's old Blinn-Phong specular replaced by composite's GGX microfacet model with proper Fresnel — physically consistent with terrain PBR.
*   **3D Geometric Waves:** Vertex shader waves physically displace the water mesh in real-time, and react to `rainStrength` / `thunderStrength` for choppier seas during storms.
*   **Independent Ripple & Specular Controls** _(since v0.2.0)_: `WATER_RIFFLES` (Calm / Standard / Choppy) and `WATER_SPECULAR_STRENGTH` (Soft / Standard / Glinting) can be tuned separately for the perfect water mood.
*   **Zero Feedback Glitches:** Designed to be extremely stable, utilizing no feedback-loop depth buffer reads to guarantee bug-free solid rendering on all GPUs.

### 🌧️ 6. Dynamic Weather Surfaces _(since v0.2.0)_

*   **Wet Reflections:** During rain, solid blocks like grass, dirt, and stone darken and become glossy, picking up sky reflections under open weather. Disables itself under roofs.
*   **Low Ground Mist (Y ≈ 60–70)** _(refined in v0.2.5)_: Soft fog sheets drift across water and ice surfaces at dawn and dusk. Uses large slow sheets + small breakup noise with optical distance accumulation for natural-looking radiation fog. Humidity from rain/wetness makes the mist persist longer.
*   **Camera-Inside-Mist Veil** _(v0.2.5)_: Standing inside the mist layer produces a subtle whole-view forward-scattering veil.
*   **Thunderstorm Awareness:** Shaders distinguish between regular rain and full thunderstorms via the `thunderStrength` uniform, intensifying cloud darkness and wave chop accordingly.

### 🌿 7. Lively Foliage

*   Waving animations for oak/spruce/birch leaves, tall grass, flowers, vines, lily pads, and crops.
*   Gently animated using hardware-optimized sine waves and time constants.
*   🧊 **Ice fix** _(since v0.2.0, refined in v1.0.4)_: regular ice renders with texture + semi-transparency; packed/blue ice renders opaque with texture. All ice types have waving and refraction disabled to eliminate visual glitches.
*   🪟 **Glass rendering** _(v1.0.4)_: all glass blocks and panes (including every stained-glass variant and tinted glass) now render with their actual texture and proper transparency via the dedicated translucent terrain pass.

### 💎 8. Full LabPBR 1.3 Material Support + POM — _PBR refined in v0.2.5_

*   **3D Normal Maps:** Real-time **TBN (Tangent-Binormal-Normal)** matrices generate true three-dimensional depth on blocks (stone crevices, brick joints) reacting dynamically to light angles.
*   **Specular Reflection (GGX Microfacet):** Polished surfaces give sharp glossy glints, while metallic surfaces (gold, copper, iron) tint the specular reflection with the block's native albedo. _(v0.2.5: correct NdotL cosine factor added for Cook-Torrance BRDF accuracy.)_
*   🧱 **Parallax Occlusion Mapping (POM)** _(since v0.2.0)_: True per-pixel block relief that pops out of the surface. Configurable `POM_DEPTH` (1–3) and `POM_STEPS` (1–4). Disabled in all profiles by default for stability; can be enabled manually. Recommended to keep off on incompatible resource packs.
*   _Seamless Fallback:_ Falls back automatically to gorgeous flat vanilla textures if no PBR resource pack is active.

### 🌀 9. Cosmic Nether Portal _(since v0.2.0, improved in v0.2.5)_

The vanilla Nether portal texture is procedurally transformed into a **swirling 3D plasma vortex** — animated purple/magenta cosmic energy that pulses with hypnotic depth. Mapped via dedicated block ID `10006` in `block.properties`. _(v0.2.5: portal pixels are flagged as emissive so composite skips scene lighting and displays the plasma as-is.)_

### 🪟 10. Translucent Block Rendering _(added in v1.0.4, unchanged in v1.0.6)_

AuraLite renders translucent blocks with proper per-block transparency through a dedicated `gbuffers_terrain_translucent` pass, ensuring correct display on both Iris and Oculus pipelines:

*   **Regular ice** — semi-transparent with actual texture; opacity scales with `WATER_TRANSPARENCY` (Clear / Balanced / Deep).
*   **Packed ice / blue ice / frosted ice** — opaque with texture, visually distinct from regular ice.
*   **All glass blocks and panes** — every vanilla glass type (clear, all 16 stained variants, pane variants, tinted glass) renders with its actual texture and correct transparency. No more invisible glass against bright skies.

### 🎬 11. Cinematic Post-Processing — _Refined in v1.0.1, v1.0.3_

*   **Multiple Tone Mapping Curves** _(since v0.2.0)_: Pick from **Soft**, **Filmic (ACES)**, or **Intense (High Contrast)** to match your preferred mood.
*   **Color Vibrancy** _(since v0.2.0)_: 4-step non-linear saturation control (_Muted / Balanced / Colorful / Vivid_) that makes foliage glow emerald and skies look lush, without crushing skin tones.
*   **Exposure Brightness:** Muted / Balanced / Vibrant — global brightness lift.
*   **Subtle Vignette:** Gentle lens-darkening at screen edges for improved depth and immersion.

### 🔥 12. Procedural Lava & Heat Shimmer _(v1.0.6)_

*   **Procedural Magma Surface:** Lava and flowing-lava blocks are rendered with a procedural Voronoi crack field, animated convection flow, rare hot spots, and rising bubbles.
*   **3D Parallax Cracks:** A 4-step parallax occlusion raymarch gives real depth between the dark basalt crust and glowing magma.
*   **Viscous Vertex Waves:** The top face slowly swells with a heavier, slower wave than water, giving a molten feel.
*   **Heat Shimmer:** `final.fsh` applies a subtle screen-space distortion above lava pixels to simulate rising hot air.
*   **PBR-Ready:** Rough basalt crust (0.95) and glossy magma cracks (0.02) produce physically plausible highlights.

### 🛡️ 13. Realistic Atmospheric Fog _(v0.2.5)_

*   Fog density now accounts for **altitude** (aerosol concentration decays with height), **horizon path length**, and **indoor/outdoor exposure** via skylight.
*   Consistent Beer-Lambert distance fog with height-weighted density — no delayed fog walls.

## ☁️ Cloud Altitude Classification

AuraLite's sky is meteorologically modeled after the international cloud classification system:

```
Altitude (m)
16 000 ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─  ↑ Cumulonimbus (Cb)
12 000 ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─│
10 000   Ci  ─ Cirrus              │ Vertical
 8 000   Cc  ─ Cirrocumulus         │ Development
 6 000 ─ ─ Cs ─ Cirrostratus ─ ─ ─ ─│─ High Clouds (Cirrus layer)
 5 000   Ac  ─ Altocumulus          │
 4 000   As  ─ Altostratus          │
 2 000 ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─│─ Mid Clouds
 1 500   Sc  ─ Stratocumulus        │
 1 000   St  ─ Stratus              │
 500     Ns  ─ Nimbostratus         │─ Low Clouds (Cumulus layer)
   0 ─ ─ Cu ─ Cumulus ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─│
```

_AuraLite smoothly transitions these layers based on in-game weather conditions (clearing, rain, or storms)._

***

## ⚙️ Performance Optimizations (OpenGL 4.6 Native)

AuraLite is built from the ground up for maximum FPS using OpenGL 4.6 native hardware operations:

*   **Multiply-Add Friendly Math:** Wave and waving-foliage math is written as simple multiply-add expressions so modern drivers can optimize it efficiently, while avoiding the explicit `fma()` intrinsic that caused compilation issues on some GPUs / Mesa drivers.
*   **Bitwise Noise Generation:** Replacing slow transcendental float functions (`fract(sin(dot(...)))`) with ultra-fast **Integer Bitwise PCG-style hashes** utilizing `floatBitsToUint` and `uintBitsToFloat`.
*   **Early-Ray Termination:** Volumetric raymarching terminates instantly once cloud transmittance falls below 2%, saving rendering power.
*   **No Hand Transparency Glitches:** Handheld items, particles, and mobs are rendered in a separate stable path without tangent matrix overhead, eliminating "translucent hand" bugs.
*   **Dead Code Elimination** _(v0.2.3–v0.2.5)_: Removed unused noise/fbm functions, dead cloud raymarching code from `gbuffers_skybasic`, and redundant render calls to reduce GPU compilation time.
*   **Profile-Based Scaling:** Every feature (POM, Auroras, SSAO, Cozy Lights, Wet Reflections, Ground Mist, Shadow Distance, Cloud Distance, Sun Halo, etc.) is intelligently distributed across the **LOW / MED / HIGH / ULTRA / EXTREME** profiles so low-end systems don't pay for effects they can't afford.
